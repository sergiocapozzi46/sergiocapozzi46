- 👋 Hi, I’m Sergio Capozzi. I was a Power Transformer development engineer for 35 years. As manager or associate of different teams, I contributed to the development not only of the machine itself but also of the used software and trained the people (engineers) in dozens of worldwide locations that used our very specific software.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Statistics, Quantum Mechanics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TensorFlow and deepning my knowledge of SKLEARN.
- 💞️ Since 2012 I am retired. I am now 75 years old and have been training myself quite a bit in SKLEARN, SELENIUM, BEAUTIFULSOUP and PANDAS.
I would love to be engaged in some task having to do with Machine Learning and or Data Science areas.
- 📫 How to reach me? My email is sergio@capozzi.de
